# Kathleen Ly

As a self-motivated and driven individual with a curiosity in technology, I decided to leave my established career as a Town Planner to pursue my passion in software development and to seek a more fulfilling and creative professional direction. 

I began my career-changing journey with Makers Academy taking part in their 4 month bootcamp, where I adopted coding best-practices and developed a strong understanding of programming fundamentals. The nature of the bootcamp enabled me to both effectively self-manage during independent projects, as well as collaborate as part of a productive team to produce high-quality work.

The marvels of modern technology keep me both motivated and dedicated to working within the industry, where it is already driving meaningful change in almost every major industry.

## Skills

### Tech Skills

- Ruby, Javascript
- Rspec, Sinatra, Capybara
- Jest, Node.js, Express, React, Cypress, React Testing
- HTML, CSS, Handlebars
- SQL, PostgreSQL, TablePlus
- MongoDB, MongoDB Compass & Atlas, Mongoose

### Soft Skills

#### Communication
I have well-refined written and verbal communication skills which I have developed throughout my professional career and most recently at Makers Academy. As a Town Planner and having worked in both regional and metropolitan Councils in Melbourne and London, my role has been to effectively communicate, advocate and negotiate on complex planning matters relating to the built environment. This has included writing detailed reports, attending developer meetings, tribunals and committees. 

Makers Academy strongly embeds pair programming into its bootcamp, meaning this has become second nature to me. This has developed my ability to solve problems collaboratively and further enhanced my communicative style. When working within a group or pairing environment, I am able to effectively articulate project needs and resolve challenges that arise.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (January 2022 - May 2022)
16-week learning and development at one of Europe's leading software engineering bootcamps focusing on the following:
- Development of programming fundamentals including SOLID and OOP; with a strong focus on test and behaviour driven development and continuous integration.
- Incorporation of features, integration and unit testing with experience in Rspec, Jest, Capybara, and Cypress.
- Proficient coding in both Ruby and Javascript.
- Experience in full stack web development on both client and server side; resulting in a deep understanding of the MVC: understanding of PostgreSQL and MongoDB; and experience with HTML and CSS.
- Developed a number of group projects using the MERN and MEHN stack as well as use of APIs. 
- Previous experience in and technology-focused development in communication, team work and time management skills.
- Significant exposure and experience with pair programming.
- Developed ability to be language agnostic as a result of self-directed learning, regular reflection and evaluation of learning processes.
- Providing mentorship to new students.

A big part of my Makers journey was the advocacy of self-directed learning, by setting daily goals and cherry picking what I needed to specifically learn and/or improve on. Please see my [Portfolio](https://github.com/heykathl/Portfolio) which gives an insight to my learning journey at Makers Academy. 
In addition to the above, I've written daily [blogs](link) delving into my thoughts and a rollercoaster of emotions throughout this course.

#### Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (February 2011 - December 2015)

- Bachelor of Urban and Regional Planning (First Class Honours)

## Work Experience

London Borough of Tower Hamlets (April 2019 - December 2021)

- Preparation of detailed legal appeal submissions and representation of the Council at hearings.
- Negotiate and secure complex legal agreements and planning obligations.
- Review and approve development applications of junior planners.
- Representation of the Council at Development Committee Meetings and appeal hearings. 

I've developed a number of soft skills which I believe would be transferrable and beneficial within the tech industry, as described above. 

## Hobbies

I often find myself exploring London, with an attempt to find every cafe with great coffee; travelling around the UK and throughout Europe. 
I have an interest in fitness and self-care, where I enjoy going to the gym, hiking and have recently picked up cycling.
