# Kathleen Ly

As a self-motivated and driven individual with a curiosity in technology, I decided to leave my established career as a Town Planner to pursue my passion in software development and to seek a more fulfilling and creative professional direction. 

I began my career-changing journey with Makers Academy taking part in their 4 month bootcamp, where I adopted coding best-practices and developed a strong understanding of programming fundamentals. The nature of the bootcamp enabled me to both effectively self-manage during independent projects, as well as collaborate as part of a productive team to produce high-quality work.

The marvels of modern technology keep me both motivated and dedicated to working within the industry, where it is already driving meaningful change in almost every major industry.

## Skills

### Tech Skills

- Ruby, Javascript
- Rspec, Sinatra, Capybara
- Jest, Node.js, Express, React, Cypress, React Testing
- HTML, CSS, Handlebars
- SQL, PostgreSQL, TablePlus
- MongoDB, MongoDB Compass & Atlas, Mongoose

### Soft Skills

#### Communication
I have well-refined written and verbal communication skills which I have developed throughout my professional career and most recently at Makers Academy. As a Town Planner and having worked in both regional and metropolitan Councils in Melbourne and London, my role has been to effectively communicate, advocate and negotiate on complex planning matters relating to the built environment. This has included writing detailed reports, attending developer meetings, tribunals and committees. 

Makers Academy strongly embeds pair programming into its bootcamp, meaning this has become second nature to me. This has developed my ability to solve problems collaboratively and further enhanced my communicative style. When working within a group or pairing environment, I am able to effectively articulate project needs and resolve challenges that arise.

### Team Player
I am a dedicated team player, which has been evident throughout my professional career and during my time at Makers bootcamp. I have always thrived within a team environment where this has allowed me to collaborate and build strong values, which I see as vital to ensuring a high performing organisation. 

During my time at Makers, I have continuously demonstrated an effective collaborative mindset within group environments to create high quality projects. One notable mention is the ‘Travel Angel’ platform which is a web application that myself and a team produced. The web application uploads details and documents relating to upcoming travel plans. Throughout the application’s two-week production, the team and I provided both technical and EQ support. We ran two daily stand ups and a retrospective catchup at the end of each day to manage our workflow and ensured that everyone felt heard. 

I always seek to develop strong relationships and aspire to display positivity amongst colleagues, and strongly value the key fundamentals of teamwork. I have recently had the opportunity to further develop this skillset where I have taken on mentorship responsibilities for students in later cohorts of the Makers Bootcamp. Through this mentorship, I've provided guidance on learning outcomes, wellbeing support and overall encouragement.

#### Organisation and Time Management
Effective time management and working well under pressure are skills that I excel at. I am productive, proactive and committed to achieving success. I am a self-managed, organised person and have a number of tools and techniques I employ to ensure deadlines, milestones and targets are met – this has been showcased through my time at Makers Academy. 

My organisational skills have been established through the various projects that I’ve completed, particularly my last two group projects. We used a number of organisational tools to prioritise agile development. This included Trello, a Kanban project board for managing tickets and observing workflow, Google drive, to store our resources and documentation of our daily stand-ups and retros, and GitHub issues, to focus on important tasks and manage workflow simultaneously. Additionally, I've used a variety of tools to assist with my note-taking and process modelling, such as Quiver, Miro and Diagrams.net.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (January 2022 - May 2022)
16-week learning and development at one of Europe's leading software engineering bootcamps focusing on the following:
- Development of programming fundamentals including SOLID and OOP; with a strong focus on test and behaviour driven development and continuous integration.
- Incorporation of features, integration and unit testing with experience in Rspec, Jest, Capybara, and Cypress.
- Proficient coding in both Ruby and Javascript.
- Experience in full stack web development on both client and server side; resulting in a deep understanding of the MVC: understanding of PostgreSQL and MongoDB; and experience with HTML and CSS.
- Developed a number of group projects using the MERN and MEHN stack as well as use of APIs. 
- Previous experience in and technology-focused development in communication, team work and time management skills.
- Significant exposure and experience with pair programming.
- Developed ability to be language agnostic as a result of self-directed learning, regular reflection and evaluation of learning processes.
- Providing mentorship to new students.

A big part of my Makers journey was the advocacy of self-directed learning, by setting daily goals and cherry picking what I needed to specifically learn and/or improve on. Please see my [Portfolio](https://github.com/heykathl/Portfolio) which gives an insight to my learning journey at Makers Academy. 
In addition to the above, I've written daily [blogs](link) delving into my thoughts and a rollercoaster of emotions throughout this course.

## Hobbies

I often find myself exploring London, with an attempt to find every cafe with great coffee; travelling around the UK and throughout Europe. 
I have an interest in fitness and self-care, where I enjoy going to the gym, hiking and have recently picked up cycling.
