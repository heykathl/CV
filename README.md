As a self-motivated and driven individual with a curiosity in technology, I decided to leave my established career as a Town Planner to pursue my passion in software development and to seek a more fulfilling and creative professional direction. 

I began my career-changing journey with Makers Academy taking part in their 4 month bootcamp, where I adopted coding best-practices and developed a strong understanding of programming fundamentals. The nature of the bootcamp enabled me to both effectively self-manage during independent projects, as well as collaborate as part of a productive team to produce high-quality work.

I have a hunger to continuously learn and further develop my skills. I have the creative desire to test new concepts and the analytical drive to see if they work. An innate curiosity will equip me with the skills needed to spot opportunities and solve problems.

The marvels of modern technology keep me both motivated and dedicated to working within the industry, where it is already driving meaningful change in almost every major industry.

## Skills

In addition to the tech skills developed as a result of my time at Makers Academy, I further enhanced my existing soft skills that will be transferable and beneficial within the tech industry.

### Soft Skills

#### Communication
I have well-refined written and verbal communication skills which I have developed throughout my professional career and most recently at Makers Academy. In my previous professional role as a Town Planner, I've been able to effectively communicate, advocate and negotiate with a broad range of developers, landowners and end-user businesses to achieve best-practice planning outcomes. I worked on projects ranging from complex land-ownership and use issues to large-scale, commercial tall buildings within East London. This has included writing detailed reports and attending developer meetings, tribunals and committees. 

Makers Academy strongly embeds pair programming into its bootcamp, meaning this has become second nature to me. This has developed my ability to solve problems collaboratively and further enhanced my communicative style. When working within a group or pairing environment, I can effectively articulate project needs and resolve challenges that arise.

#### Team Player
I am a dedicated team player, which has been evident throughout my professional career and during my time at Makers bootcamp. I have always thrived within a team environment where this has allowed me to collaborate and build strong values, which I see as vital to ensuring a high performing organisation. 

During my time at Makers, I have continuously demonstrated an effective collaborative mindset within group environments to create high quality projects. One notable mention is the ‘Travel Angel’ platform which is a web application that myself and a team produced. The web application uploads details and documents relating to upcoming travel plans. Throughout the application’s two-week production, the team and I provided both technical and EQ support. We ran two daily stand ups and a retrospective catchup at the end of each day to manage our workflow and ensured that everyone felt heard. 

I always seek to develop strong relationships and aspire to display positivity amongst colleagues, and strongly value the key fundamentals of teamwork. I have recently had the opportunity to further develop this skillset where I have taken on mentorship responsibilities for students in later cohorts of the Makers Bootcamp. Through this mentorship, I've provided guidance on learning outcomes, wellbeing support and overall encouragement.

#### Organisation and Time Management
Effective time management and working well under pressure are skills that I excel at. I am productive, proactive and committed to achieving success. I am a self-managed, organised person and have a number of tools and techniques I employ to ensure deadlines, milestones and targets are met – this has been showcased through both my previous work experience and my time at Makers Academy.

Within my past work experience, my role included consistently managing a caseload of up to 80 individual planning applications, each with their own set of clients, agents and consultees; appeal submissions and hearings, development committee and pre-application meetings, and counter and phone duties. Through this, I am able to prioritise tasks and ensure that my time is used efficiently. 

My organisational skills have been further established through various projects that I’ve completed, particularly my last two group projects. We used a number of organisational tools to prioritise agile development. This included Trello, a Kanban project board for managing tickets and observing workflow, Google drive, to store our resources and documentation of our daily stand-ups and retros, and GitHub issues, to focus on important tasks and manage workflow simultaneously. Additionally, I've used a variety of tools to assist with my note-taking and process modelling, such as Quiver, Miro and Diagrams.net.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (January 2022 - May 2022)
16-week learning and development at one of Europe's leading software engineering bootcamps focusing on the following:
- Development of programming fundamentals including SOLID and OOP; with a strong focus on test and behaviour driven development and continuous integration.
- Incorporation of features, integration and unit testing with experience in Rspec, Jest, Capybara, and Cypress.
- Proficient coding in both Ruby and Javascript.
- Experience in full stack web development on both client and server side; resulting in a deep understanding of the MVC: understanding of PostgreSQL and MongoDB; and experience with HTML and CSS.
- Developed a number of group projects using the MERN and MEHN stack as well as use of APIs. 
- Previous experience in and technology-focused development in communication, team work and time management skills.
- Significant exposure and experience with pair programming.
- Developed ability to be language agnostic as a result of self-directed learning, regular reflection and evaluation of learning processes.
- Providing mentorship to new students.

A big part of my Makers journey has been centred around self-directed learning. I set clear, daily goals and cherry pick what I need to specifically learn and/or improve on. Please see my [Portfolio](https://github.com/heykathl/Portfolio) which gives an insight into my learning journey at Makers Academy. 
In addition to the above, I have written a [Blog]() delving into my daily thoughts, reflections and overall rollercoaster of emotions throughout the duration of the bootcamp.
